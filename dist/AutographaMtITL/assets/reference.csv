This refers to obeying the laws of Moses. Now they "serve" the new covenant. That is, because of Jesus'' sacrifice on the cross, believers in Jesus are enabled by the Holy Spirit to please God and live holy lives. * Paul talks about their actions in terms of their "service" to either the old or new covenant. This could be translated as "serving" or "obeying" or "devotion to." * Christians are also called "slaves to righteousness," which is a metaphor that compares the commitment to obey God to a slave''s commitment to obey his master.    )'	G1249,G1401,G1402,G2324,G3407,G3411,G3610,G3816,G4983,G5257	44004029 ,44004030 ,44004031 ,44010007 ,44010008 ,51001007 ,51001008 ,51003022 ,51003023 ,51003024 ,51003025 ,42012047 ,42012048 ,41009033 ,41009034 ,41009035 ,40010024 ,40010025 ,40013027 ,40013028 ,55002003 ,55002004 ,55002005 ,44006002 ,44006003 ,44006004 ,42012037 ,42012038 ,42022026 ,42022027 ,41008007 ,41008008 ,41008009 ,41008010 ,40004010 ,40004011 ,40006024

The juice eventually ferments and alcohol forms in it. * In Bible times, wine was the normal drink with meals. It did not have as much alcohol as present-day wine has. * Before wine was served for a meal, it was often mixed with water. * A wineskin that was old and brittle would get cracks in it, which allowed the wine to leak out. New wineskins were soft and flexible, which meant they did not tear easily and could store the wine safely. * If wine is unknown in your culture, it could be translated as "fermented grape juice" or "fermented drink made from a fruit called grapes" or "fermented fruit juice." (See: [How to Translate Unknowns](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown)) * Ways to translate "wineskin" could include "bag for wine" or "animal skin wine bag" or "animal skin container for wine."

1038	winepress	दाखरस के कुण्ड	'During Bible times, a "winepress" was a large container or open place where the juice of grapes was extracted in order to make wine.  * In Israel, winepresses were usually large, wide basins that were dug out of solid rock. Clusters of grapes were put on the flat bottom of the hole and people trampled the grapes with their feet to get the grape juice to flow out. * Usually a winepress had two levels, with the grapes being trampled in the top level so that the juice would run down into the lower level where it could be collected. * The term "winepress" is also used figuratively in the Bible as a picture of God''s wrath being poured out on wicked people.

1039	winnow, winnows, winnowed, winnowing, sift, sifting	फटकना, फटकता, फटका, फटकेगा, फटके, छानना	The terms "winnow" and "sift" mean to separate grain from unwanted materials. In the Bible, both words are also used in a figurative sense to refer to separating or dividing people.  * To "winnow" means to separate grain from the unwanted parts of the plant by tossing both the grain and chaff into the air, allowing the wind to blow the chaff away. * The word "sift" refers to shaking the winnowed grain in a sieve to get rid of any remaining unwanted materials, such as dirt or stones. * In the Old Testament, "winnow" and "sift" are used figuratively to describe hardship that separates the righteous people from the unrighteous people. * Jesus also used the term "sift" in this figurative way when he was telling Simon Peter about how he and the other disciples would be tested in their faith. * To translate these terms, use the words or phrases in the project language that refer to these activities; possible translations might be "shaking" or "fanning." If winnowing or sifting are not known, then these terms could be translated by a term that refers to a different method of separating grain from chaff or dirt, or by describing this process.

1040	wise men	बुद्धिमानों	'In the Bible, the phrase "wise men" often refers to men who serve God and act wisely, not foolishly. This is also a special term that refers to men with unusual knowledge and abilities who served as part of a king''s court.  * Sometimes the term "wise men" is explained in the text as "prudent men" or "men with understanding." This refers to men who act wisely and righteously because they obey God. * The "wise men" who served pharaohs and other kings were often scholars who studied the stars, especially looking for special meanings for the patterns that the stars made in their positions in the sky. * Often wise men were expected to explain the meanings of dreams. For example, King Nebuchadnezzar demanded that his wise men describe his dreams and tell him what they meant, but none of them was able to do this, except Daniel who had received this knowledge from God. * Sometimes wise men also performed magical acts such as divination or miracles that were done through the power of evil spirits. * In the New Testament, the group of men who came from eastern regions to worship Jesus were called "magi," which is often translated as "wise men," since this probably refers to scholars who served a ruler of an eastern country. * It is very probable that these men were astrologers who studied the stars. Some have thought that they may have been descendants of the wise men whom Daniel taught when he was in Babylon. * Depending on the context, the term "wise men" could be translated using the term "wise" or with a phrase such as "gifted men" or "educated men" or some other term that refers to men who have an important job working for a ruler. * When "wise men" is simply a noun phrase, the word "wise" should be translated in the same or similar way to how it is translated elsewhere in the Bible.   )'	G4680		
1041	wolf, wolves, wild dogs	भेड़िया, भेड़िए, जंगली कुत्ते	A wolf is a fierce, meat-eating animal that is similar to a wild dog.  * Wolves usually hunt in groups and stalk their prey in a clever and stealthy manner. * In the Bible, the term "wolves" is used figuratively to refer to false teachers or false prophets who destroy believers, who are compared to sheep. False teaching causes people to believe wrong things that bring harm to them. * This comparison is based on the fact that sheep are especially vulnerable to being attacked and eaten by wolves, because they are weak and cannot defend themselves.

1042	womb, wombs	गर्भ	'The term "womb" refers to where a baby grows inside its mother.  * This is an older term that is sometimes used in order to be polite and less direct. (See: [euphemism](rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism)) * A more modern term for womb is "uterus." * Some languages use a word like "belly" to refer to a woman''s womb or uterus. * Use a word for this in the project language that is well-known, natural, and acceptable.'

1046	yeast, leaven, leavens, leavened, unleavened	ख़मीर, ख़मीरी, ख़मीर, ख़मीर बनाना, अख़मीरी	'"Leaven" is a general term for a substance that causes bread dough to expand and rise. "Yeast" is a specific kind of leaven.  * In some English translations, the word for leaven is translated as "yeast," which is a modern leavening agent that fills the bread dough with gas bubbles, making the dough expand before baking it. The yeast is kneaded into the dough so that it spreads throughout the entire lump of dough. * In Old Testament times, the leavening or rising agent was produced by allowing the dough to sit for awhile. Small amounts of dough from a previous batch of dough were saved as leavening for the next batch. * When the Israelites escaped from Egypt, they didn''t have time to wait for bread dough to rise, so they made bread without leaven to take with them on their journey. As a reminder of this, every year the Jewish people celebrate Passover by eating bread that has no leaven in it. * The term "leaven" or "yeast" is used figuratively in the Bible as a picture of how sin spreads through a person''s life or how sin can influence other people. * It can also refer to false teaching which often spreads to many people and influences them. * The term "leaven" is also used in a positive way to explain how the influence of God''s kingdom spreads from person to person.'

This could also be translated as "fellow worker" or "fellow servant" or "coworker." * The term "yoke" is also often used figuratively to refer to a heavy load that someone has to carry, such as when being oppressed by slavery or persecution. * In most contexts, it is best to translate this term literally, using the local term for a yoke that is used for farming. * Other ways to translate the figurative use of this term could be, "oppressive burden" or "heavy load" or "bond," depending on the context.
